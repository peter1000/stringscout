/*
 * ABOUT THE CODE:
 *
 * This is a native implementation of a buffered string search algorithm
 *
 * The chunk size was obtained by profiling the binary.
 * The best observed value was 16k.
 *
 * The performance of this implementations is very similar to the GNU strings
 * for general string search.
